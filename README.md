Hello everyone.Here I will be posting what I learnt during 2 weeks workshop under VSD.
* Learning the importance of VLSI in today's world.
* Aurdino as example,learnt what is pakaging actually and this package contain small chip.
* Different types of packaging such as QFN(quad flat no-leads), DIP(dual-in line pacakging), TO packaging and other different types

  
 chip as following parameter:
 
 *PADs are the one's through which signal flows inside and outside of the chip.
 
 *Core is one where the digital logic gates are connected.
 
 *Die is one which determines the size of chip.

**Introduction to RISC-V architecture:**
The instructions are the only way through  which  machine can understand  what operations it has to perform. ISA which mean" Instruction Set Architecture" is communicating with machine. Here we write code in c,c++ or java language then through assembler this code will be converted into assembly level language and then to the machine level language as 1or 0. 
RTL  of the design is expressed through hardware description language which will be applied to the layout.
